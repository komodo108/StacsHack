# StacsHack
Project done for StacsHack 2019 over the course of 24 hours!

### Motivation
This project was done over the course of the StacsHack 2019 hackathon.
We want to *break the ice*.

### Cool BOIIIIIIIIII
Co-operative Multiplayer Game

Two players play against the clock to escape an icey maze, one player needs to support the ice breaker to break the ice blocking the path to the exit by getting them critical support items to *break the ice*.

Both players will need to answer questions about each other to be able to get through the maze! (Such as having to answer a question when breaking the ice, or having to answer a question when getting an item). They will also have to complete a **final challenge** to exit the maze and escape!

### Implementation
The implementation is based upon a custom network solution [from GUTS](https://github.com/komodo108/GUTS) and Java Swing for simple interaction.
